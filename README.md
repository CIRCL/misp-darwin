# MISP Darwin

A research partnership with [Universit√© de Lorraine](https://www.univ-lorraine.fr/) to improve MISP threat intelligence into
human-readable information such as:

- Interpretation of technical information such as an indicator into a human readable information
- Improving capabilities of organisations (such as what to do depending of information gathered from MISP) and propose how to use specific technical information
- Creation and implementation of different views under the form of reports or web pages to allow synthetic view of the data
- Creation and implementation of an algorythm performing the task above
- Implementation of a prototype to serve the views generated by the algorythm created above
- Creation of a model proposing to technical users steps to take in order to secure their system based on indicators (e.g. For an malicious IP address, automatically generate rules to block it)
- ...
